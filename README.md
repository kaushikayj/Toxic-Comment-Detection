# Toxic-Comment-Detection
This Python code creates a **Toxic Comment Detection Bot** using the **Meta-Llama API** and **Streamlit** to classify user comments as toxic or non-toxic with specific categories. It embeds the comments and uses the API to provide real-time toxicity analysis through an interactive web interface.
