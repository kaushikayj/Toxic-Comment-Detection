 # Toxic Comment Detection & Classification using AI
Welcome to the **Toxic Comment Detection & Classification** project

In today's digital world, online platforms are full of user-generated content. While many interactions are positive, toxic comments can lead to harassment, bullying, and a negative user experience. This
project leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to detect and classify these toxic comments in real-time, promoting a safer and more respectful online environment.

##

 Overview
This project integrates advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **AI models** to classify comments as **toxic** or **non-toxic**, and categorize them based on toxicity type (e.g.,
**insults, profanity, hate speech, etc.**).
With a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface, users can easily input comments and receive instant feedback on the toxicity and its type. It uses the **Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo** model for precise
analysis.

 Key Features
- **Real-Time Toxicity Detection**: Instant classification of comments as toxic or non-toxic.
- **Toxicity Categories**: Toxic comments are categorized into specific types (e.g., insults, profanity, hate speech, etc.).
- **User Interface**: Interactive web app built with **Streamlit** for easy use.
- **Powerful AI Model**: Uses **Meta-Llama** API to detect and classify comments accurately.

 Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests streamlit langchain langchain-community
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/toxic-comment-detection.git
   cd toxic-comment-detection
---
##

Usage
1. Run the streamlit app
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
2. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501.
3. Enter a comment into the text box and click Check Toxicity to get the analysis result.

---
## Example
1. Input Comment
   ```bash
   You're so stupid, I can't stand you!

2. Output Result
   ```bash
   Toxic: Insults
   Reason: The comment contains derogatory terms like "stupid" and "can't stand you".

 How It Works
1. Text Splitting: The user’s input comment is split into smaller chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
2. Embedding: The text is embedded using OllamaEmbeddings.
3. FAISS: The embedded text is stored in a FAISS vector store to facilitate efficient similarity search.
4. Toxicity Classification: The input is sent to the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo model via an API call for toxicity detection and classification.
